## 📋 **Demo Script**

### **1. Introduction (30 seconds)**

> "Good [morning/afternoon]! I'm [Your Name] from [Team Name]. Today I'm excited to present **Ops Mesh** - a revolutionary hospital operations management system that leverages **Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and **Vertex AI** to transform healthcare workflows.

> Our project addresses a critical challenge in healthcare: **inefficient patient flow management** that leads to long wait times, frustrated patients, and overworked staff. We've built a solution that uses **AI-powered agents** to automate and optimize hospital operations in real-time."

### **2. Problem Statement (45 seconds)**

> "In today's hospitals, we face several critical challenges:
> - **Patient wait times** can exceed 2-3 hours for routine visits
> - **Staff coordination** between departments is often manual and error-prone
> - **Resource allocation** is reactive rather than predictive
> - **Patient experience** suffers due to lack of real-time information

> Traditional hospital management systems are **static and siloed**. They don't communicate with each other, leading to bottlenecks and inefficiencies. We need a **dynamic, intelligent system** that can adapt in real-time."

### **3. Our Solution (60 seconds)**

> "**Ops Mesh** is a comprehensive hospital operations platform built on **Google's cutting-edge technologies**:

> **🤖 Google ADK Integration**: We've implemented a complete **Agent Development Kit** with **A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication protocols**. Our system features:
> - **FrontDesk Agent**: Handles patient registration and check-in
> - **Queue Agent**: Manages patient flow and wait times
> - **Real-time agent communication** using A2A protocols
> - **Agent discovery and capability matching**

> **🧠 Vertex AI Enhancement**: We've integrated **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model** to provide:
> - **Intelligent conversation** with patients and staff
> - **Predictive analytics** for queue optimization
> - **Natural language processing** for better user experience
> - **AI-powered decision making** for complex scenarios"
